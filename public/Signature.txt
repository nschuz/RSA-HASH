Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields foreverhU3SzPsA6gq9o7Pz9KWCWavMvuB+4yUEWUMozz2H454Y79x1jancJ1WE1M2N0JQ0Fdi3MKrHq5ygNpIiLKViYnu1zFmcwD41gs0D4F5I2n8/fs0CnXeKzlLw/afDcErngWNLyo6TYV1bTyPaIbfd7oVfvjzHZqKt4yCJz2wAVVIRs3RiOrX6LTtI8tV9LNLxcoJD3pdC/q0Xx2kdW2tAsfvQcbndn2wM83M4Pc8KCPT1sAGT0crvKw/bCOkGAsG/u2qrqQK6iokb23HcOHFd9f+VEvOzrZzmFOUXqKL9R+ID1xHExr1VGKopzcOaPB0CUEBvn2nwNeIfGkcWpD2X4w==
